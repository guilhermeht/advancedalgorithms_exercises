# Advanced Algorithms Exercises

Theses files are all from the course of Advanced Algorithms. They were all made in C++ and in each folder there's a .pdf explaining how the challenge works.
The main file is the *send.cpp* , it is where all the challenge is placed.

## Notes

As a university course exercises, there are some commentaries for myself, so don't use it for real.
